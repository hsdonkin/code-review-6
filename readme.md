# _Medical API Caller_

#### _Api calls to Better Doctor API_

#### By _**Hugh Donkin**_

## Description

_As we all know, everybody needs to see a doctor sometimes. But finding a doctor that provides the services you need nearby can be time consuming. To facilitate this, you have been asked to create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “sore throat”, "rash", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors in your city (Portland or Seattle depending on where you are) who can treat their medical issue._

## Specs
